These Terms of Service (”Terms”) describe our commitments to you, and your rights and responsibilities when using our services.


Please read them carefully and reach out to us if you have any questions.** If you don’t agree to these Terms, don’t use our services.**


If you are a user in countries located in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom (“European User”), some special terms apply to you as mentioned below.


We’ve made these Terms available under a [Creative Commons Sharealike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), which means that you’re more than welcome to copy them, adapt them, and repurpose them for your own use.


Just make sure to revise them so that your Terms of Service reflect your actual practices.


# These Terms

These Terms govern your access to and use of the software, applications, extensions, and other products and services we provide through various online platforms, including but not limited to:

  * Editor add-ons in Google Workspace Marketplace
  * Browser extensions in Google Chrome Web Store
  * Android apps in Google Play Store
  * Documents created on WordPress.com
  * Software libraries and tools on GitHub
  * Printable and markable deliverables on GitHub
  * Datasets available on GitHub Pages or other CDNs


Taken together, these items comprise our deliverables, products, and services (our "Services").


> **NOTE:** Google belongs to Alphabet. GitHub belongs to Microsoft. WordPress belongs to MOTEPAPER.


These Terms also govern visitors’ access to and use of any websites that use our Services, like the websites that use libraries and documents in the creative process.


Please note though that the operators of those websites may also have their own separate terms of use. Likewise, each repository is bound by specific licenses and related terms.


Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services.


By accessing or using any part of our Services, you agree to be bound by all of the Terms and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish via the Services from time to time (collectively, the “Agreement”).


You also agree that we may automatically change, update, or add on to our Services as stated in the Terms, and the Agreement will apply to any changes.


# 1\. Who's Who

“You” means any individual or entity using our Services.


If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you’re authorized to accept the Agreement on that person’s or entity’s behalf, that by using our Services you’re accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.

# 2\. Your Account

There are no user accounts at MOTETPAPER.



# 3\. Minimum Age Requirements

Our Services are not directed to children. You’re not allowed to access or use our Services if you’re under the age of 13 (or 16 in Europe).


You may use our Services only if you can legally form a binding contract with us.


In other words, if you’re under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where you live), you can only use our Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to the Agreement.


# 4\. Responsibility of Visitors and Users

We haven’t reviewed, and can’t review, all of the content (like text, photo, video, audio, code, computer software, documents, items for sale, and other materials) posted to or made available through our Services by users or anyone else (”Content”) or on websites that link to, or are linked from, our Services. We’re not responsible for any use or effects of Content or third-party websites.

Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content you download, copy, or use.

There are no fees, payments, or renewals.

# 10\. Intellectual Property

The Agreement doesn’t transfer any MOTEPAPER or third-party intellectual property to you, and all right, title, and interest in and to such property remains (as between MOTEPAPER and you) solely with MOTEPAPER.

Other trademarks, service marks, graphics, and logos used in connection with our Services may be the trademarks of other third parties.

# 11\. Third-Party Services

Each third-party service has terms and conditions. Please read those terms and conditions for details.

# 12\. Changes

We may modify the Terms from time to time, for example, to reflect changes to our Services (e.g., adding new features or benefits to our Services or retiring certain features of certain Services) or for legal, regulatory, or security reasons. If we do this, we’ll provide notice of the changes, such as by posting the amended Terms and updating the “Last Updated” date or, if the changes, in our sole discretion, are material, we may notify you through our Services or other communications. Any changes will apply on a going-forward basis, and, unless we say otherwise, the amended Terms will be effective immediately. By continuing to use our Services after we’ve notified you, you agree to be bound by the new Terms. You have the right to object to any changes at any time by ceasing your use of our Services and canceling any subscription you have.


# 13\. Termination

We may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause or notice, effective immediately, including if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have violated this Agreement, any service guidelines, or other applicable terms. We have the right (though not the obligation) to (i) reclaim your username or website’s URL due to prolonged inactivity, (ii) refuse or remove any content that, in our reasonable opinion, violates any part of this Agreement or any MOTEPAPER policy, or is in any way harmful or objectionable, (iii) ask you to make adjustments, restrict the resources your website uses, or terminate your access to the Services, if we believe your website’s storage or bandwidth usage burdens our systems (which is rare and typically only occurs when a website is used for file sharing or storage), or (iv) terminate or deny access to and use of any of our Services to any individual or entity for any reason. We will have no obligation to provide a refund of any fees previously paid.


You can stop using our Services at any time, or, if you use a Paid Service, you can cancel at any time, subject to the Fees, Payment, and Renewal section of these Terms.


# 14\. Disclaimers

Our Services are provided “as is.” MOTEPAPER and its suppliers and licensors hereby disclaim all warranties of any kind, express or implied, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. Neither MOTEPAPER, nor its suppliers and licensors, makes any warranty that our Services will be error free or that access thereto will be continuous or uninterrupted.

MOTEPAPER shall have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond its reasonable control. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

European Users: If we cause damage to you and you are a consumer in Europe, we limit our liability to the maximum amount permissible in your country of residence. Liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. MOTEPAPER isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability will not apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, liability caused by our willful misconduct or gross negligence, or our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you. You and we agree that we and our affiliates’ total liability is limited to the greater of $50 or the amount paid by you to use our Services during the 12 months preceding the claim; To the extent that our liability is limited or excluded, the limitations or exclusions will also apply to the personal liability of our employees, legal representatives, and vicarious agents.


# 17\. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless MOTEPAPER, its contractors, and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your use of our Services, including but not limited to your violation of the Agreement or any agreement with a provider of third-party services used in connection with the Services or applicable law, Content that you post, and any ecommerce activities conducted through your or another user’s website.


# 18\. US Economic Sanctions

You agree that our ability to provide our Services to you is subject to compliance with US sanctions that restrict or prohibit who or from where our Services can be accessed. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you (i) are not located or residing in any country or territory subject to comprehensive US sanctions (currently Cuba, Crimea, Iran, North Korea, Donetsk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, and Syria); (ii) are not listed on any United States list of prohibited or restricted parties, such as [OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Persons List](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists), or otherwise subject to US sanctions that would prohibit your access to or use of our Services; and (iii) shall not use or allow access by any of your customers or potential customers (if applicable) to the Services in any manner that may cause MOTEPAPER to violate US export controls and sanctions. We reserve the right to restrict or block your access, or access by any of your customers or potential customers (if applicable), to the Services and/or to terminate the Agreement at any time without notice if we determine, at our sole discretion, that such access may cause a violation or create unacceptable risk to us under export controls or sanctions.


# 19\. Data Processing Agreement

# 20\. Translation

These Terms were originally written in English (US). We may translate these terms into other languages, and in the event of a conflict between a translated version of these Terms and the English version, the English version will control.


# 21\. Miscellaneous

The Agreement (together with any other terms we provide that apply to any specific Service) constitutes the entire agreement between MOTEPAPER and you concerning our Services. If any part of the Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part is severable from the Agreement, and does not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Agreement. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of the Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.


MOTEPAPER may assign its rights under the Agreement without condition. You may only assign your rights under the Agreement with our prior written consent.
